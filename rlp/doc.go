Package rlp implements the RLP serialization format.

The purpose of RLP (Recursive Linear Prefix) qis to encode arbitrarily
nested arrays of binary data, and RLP is the main encoding method used

to serialize objects in Teslafunds. The only purpose of RLP is to encode
structure; encoding specific atomic data types (eg. strings, ints,
floats) is left up to higher-order protocols; in Teslafunds integers

must be represented in big endian binary form with no leading zeroes
(thus making the integer value zero be equivalent to the empty byte
array).

RLP values are distinguished by a type tag. The type tag precedes the
value in the input stream and defines the size and kind of the bytes
that follow.
